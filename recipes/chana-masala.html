      </ul>
    <h2>Steps to prepare</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Soak white chickpeas in 2 cups of water overnight or for 8-10 hours. Drain out all the water. </li>
        <li>Add chickpeas along with 2 cups of water and salt. Pressure cook for 35 minutes followed by natural pressure release. (Note: Optionally, add a tea bag to give the dish a rich smoky flavor and deep color. Discard once the chickpeas are cooked) </li>
        <li>Heat ghee in a medium skillet. Add bay leaf and onions. Saut√© on medium heat until the onions turn light golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Use a lid to speed up cooking while mixing in the onions frequently. Add ginger paste, garlic paste, and green chili. Mix well and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes stirring a few times until the tomatoes are soft and mushy.</li>
        <li>Mix well with chana masala spice blend, salt, turmeric, and red chili powder. Add boiled chickpeas along with the water from pressure cooking. Add one cup of water(more or less) to bring the curry to your desired consistency. </li>
        <li>Simmer for 5 minutes and garnish with Kasoori methi and cilantro. Serve with steamed basmati rice or paratha.</li>
      </ol>
